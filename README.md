This was a self drive holiday, but we have overlooked and forgotten to convert our driving licence to international driving licenese. Thus, we were unable to drive in Japan.

* A drop down box in the Home page is also provide for user to sort to-do items by category. 
* In "Home" page, "Edit" and "Delete" button next to the to-do items are provided for user to select. When user choose "edit" button, it will show the to-do edit page. After making changes, user need to click on the "Edit To-do' button at the end of the page" to update the changes. Alternatively, user can select "Delete" button to delete the to-do items.
* In "Add To-do" page, user can add new to-do item. As usual, user need to click "submit" button at the end of the page to update the checkup. The new add-on item will then appear on the "Home" page.
