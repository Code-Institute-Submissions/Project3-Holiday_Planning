BACKGROUND:
==========
* Holidays are meant to be relax and enjoyable.  Preparing a holiday checklist with all the necessay to-do items prior to departure is a good way to ensure everything go smoothly during holiday.
* The reason i design this checklist is due to an unpleasant experience during my holdidays in Japan Hokkaido. Actually, this was meant to be a self drive holiday. But we have forgotten to convert our driving licence to international driving licenese. Hence, we were unable to drive in Japan Hokkaido and have to do alot of last minutes planning on transportation.



UX DESIGN:

* The design of this checklist is clean cut and  user can easily understand the relevant informations.  Under navbar, it consists of "Home", "Add To-do" and "Manage Category" pages. User can view, add, edit and delete to-do item and category.
* A drop down box in the Home page navbar allow user to sort to-do item by category. 
* In "Home" page, "Edit" and "Delete" buttons are provided for every to-do item. When user choose "edit" button, it will show the to-do edit page. User need to click on the "Edit To-do' button to update the changes. User can also select "Delete" button to remove the to-do item.
* In "Add To-do" page, user can add new to-do item. User need to click "submit" button to upload the information. The new add-on item will then appear in the "Home" page.
* In "Manage Category" page, user can "Edit" and "Delete" the category.  A "Add Category" button is also provided at the end of the page.
